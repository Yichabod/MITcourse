# Python Collectible Code

This is a collection of the small projects I undertook while learning introductory Python. Most of the projects are closely inspired by the assignments in the MIT 6.001x and 6.002x online courses at (edx)[www.edx.org].

Feel free to peruse the programs; their titles should give a fair indication of what each program is for. I've done my best to make each program clearly labelled yet succinct. Enjoy!

(Note that a lot of these are written as I was learning, so they may not be the most efficient pieces of code)
